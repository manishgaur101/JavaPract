It means following:
- Keeping properties and behaviour at a same place
- Showing only the required details to outside world means DATA HIDING

- Data Hiding with encapsulation we achieve with ACCESS MODIFIERS (public, private, default, protected).
- We give getter setter methods for the properties we want to allow access.

-Encapsulation example - POJO classes.

How to implement this concept in JAVA -
----------------------------------------
1. Access modifiers - helps to provide data scope.
2. Getter/Setters   - helps to maintain data integrity via controlled allowed access.
                      By controlled access means no one can directly update the data we can apply checks also.
                      i.e. BankAccount class where the !(dispense cash > account balance)
3. Import & Package - Helps to enhance modularity.
                      Package solves naming conflicts for classes and interfaces.(java automatic imported package - java.lang)
                      Import is used to access class or interface from another package.
                      With packages we can keep the related data in same package and can hide the classes with access Modifiers.
                      To hide class - access modifiers - default(package-private), private inner class, protected(same package or child classes)
