-The Abstract Factory pattern is a powerful way to manage the complexity of creating families of
related objects in test automation.


UseCase -
----------
Multiple Related Products: When you need to create multiple related objects that belong to a family.
For example, if you are designing a UI toolkit that supports multiple themes (like dark and light themes),
you can use an abstract factory to create theme-specific components like buttons, text fields, etc.

Test Automation UseCase - MultiBrowser supporting different mode options
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Products - ChromeDriver, FirefoxDriver
Family of related Objects - ChromeDriver obj to run with "--disable-extensions" ChromeOptions
                            FireFoxdRIVER OBJ to run with same above mode.
                           Next time Run the script in both browsers in some other mode.
So the Script should support to run in multiple modes by all the Browsers.
